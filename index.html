                <p>Hello! I'm Aaron, currently enrolled in the MSU Full Stack Bootcamp, where I'm deeply engaged in learning the intricacies of web development. Before this new chapter, I owned and operated my own business for 16 years, during which I also designed our websites. This experience sparked my interest in the tech field, leading me to pursue a more formal education in coding. My portfolio showcases a selection of my work, reflecting my journey and growth in web development. I'm excited to share it with you!</p>
